To create the icon.png file:

1. Use an image conversion tool to convert the icon.svg to icon.png
   - Online tools like https://convertio.co/svg-png/ can be used
   - Or use image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or Inkscape

2. The icon should be at least 128x128 pixels in size

3. Place the icon.png file in this directory (images/)

4. The icon will be used for:
   - VS Code marketplace listing
   - Extension icon in VS Code
   - GitHub repository

Note: VS Code extension packaging (vsce) doesn't support SVG files as icons, which is why we need a PNG version.
